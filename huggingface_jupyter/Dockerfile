# Add RUN statements to install packages as the $NB_USER defined in the base images.

# Add a "USER root" statement followed by RUN statements to install system packages using apt-get,
# change file permissions, etc.

# If you do switch to root, always be sure to add a "USER $NB_USER" command at the end of the
# file to ensure the image runs as a unprivileged user by default.
